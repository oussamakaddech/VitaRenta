Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Fast responses for recommendations and predictions.
Scalability: Capable of handling large volumes of data (clients, vehicles, context).
Sustainability: Promotes eco-responsible choices through responsible AI.
Security: Robust protection of customer data.
Maintenance: Continuous improvement of ML models via a feedback system.
Innovative Features
Hybrid Recommendation Engine: Combines collaborative filtering, content-based, and contextual analysis to suggest vehicles tailored to each customer.
Advanced Gamification: Introduces "eco-responsible challenges" (e.g., "Drive 100 km in eco mode to unlock a badge") with tangible rewards.
Conversational AI Assistant: Integrates a chatbot (e.g., based on LLaMA or Grok) for real-time customer interaction.
Dynamic Route Optimization: Recommends energy-efficient routes to reduce consumption.
Predictive Maintenance: Uses telematics data (tire pressure, fuel consumption, etc.) to anticipate vehicle maintenance needs and reduce costs.
Subscription Offers: Flexible access to various vehicles on a monthly or yearly basis, catering to urban users' needs.
Technical Architecture
Web Interface: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user experience.
Mobile Application: Developed using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).

Microservices: Separates functionalities to enhance scalability.
Database:
PostgreSQL for structured data.
Support for unstructured data (details to be specified).
AI/ML Processing Layer
Recommendation Engine: Uses LightFM for hybrid recommendations and BERT-based Transformers for analyzing textual preferences.
Demand Prediction: Combines ARIMA for seasonal demand forecasting and XGBoost for contextual predictions (e.g., weather, events).
Predictive Maintenance: Employs LSTM models to analyze time-series IoT data for vehicle health monitoring.
Eco-Scoring: Custom algorithm to evaluate vehicles based on CO2 emissions and energy consumption.
