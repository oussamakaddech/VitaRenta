Functional Requirements

The platform addresses the following functional needs:





Personalized vehicle recommendations based on user preferences and context.



Real-time customer support through a conversational AI assistant.



Eco-friendly driving incentives and optimized route suggestions.



Flexible subscription-based vehicle access.

Non-Functional Requirements

The system is designed to meet the following non-functional requirements:





Performance: Fast responses for recommendations and predictions.



Scalability: Capable of handling large volumes of data (clients, vehicles, context).



Sustainability: Promotes eco-responsible choices through responsible AI.



Security: Robust protection of customer data.



Maintenance: Continuous improvement of ML models via a feedback system.

Innovative Features





Hybrid Recommendation Engine: Combines collaborative filtering, content-based, and contextual analysis to suggest vehicles tailored to each customer.



Advanced Gamification: Introduces "eco-responsible challenges" (e.g., "Drive 100 km in eco mode to unlock a badge") with tangible rewards.



Conversational AI Assistant: Integrates a chatbot (e.g., based on LLaMA or Grok) for real-time customer interaction.



Dynamic Route Optimization: Recommends energy-efficient routes to reduce consumption.



Predictive Maintenance: Uses telematics data (tire pressure, fuel consumption, etc.) to anticipate vehicle maintenance needs and reduce costs.



Subscription Offers: Flexible access to various vehicles on a monthly or yearly basis, catering to urban users' needs.

Technical Architecture

The platform leverages a modern, scalable architecture:





Web Interface: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user experience.



Mobile Application: Developed using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).



Backend Framework: Utilizes Django for a RESTful API.



Microservices: Separates functionalities to enhance scalability.



Database:





PostgreSQL for structured data.



Additional support for unstructured data (details to be specified).

AI/ML Processing Layer

The platform incorporates advanced AI/ML techniques for enhanced functionality:





Recommendation Engine: Uses LightFM for hybrid recommendations and BERT-based Transformers for analyzing textual preferences.



Demand Prediction: Combines ARIMA for seasonal demand forecasting and XGBoost for contextual predictions (e.g., weather, events).



Predictive Maintenance: Employs LSTM models to analyze time-series IoT data for vehicle health monitoring.



Eco-Scoring: Custom algorithm to evaluate vehicles based on CO2 emissions and energy consumption.

Getting Started

To set up the project locally:





Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>



Install dependencies for the backend: pip install -r requirements.txt



Set up the frontend: npm install (for React) or follow Flutter setup instructions.



Configure the database (PostgreSQL) and update settings in the Django configuration.



Run the application: python manage.py runserver for the backend and follow frontend-specific instructions.
